  * Improves 4 queries (highest query coverage)
  * 75.8% average improvement
  * Only 3.8 MB storage impact
  * Benefits both TP and AP workloads
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create index during low-traffic period
  2. Monitor query performance
  3. Validate improvement matches estimates

### 2. customer(c_custkey)
- **Priority**: High
- **Rationale**:
  * 100% improvement on affected queries
  * Minimal storage impact (2.9 MB)
  * Essential for customer lookups
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create as unique index
  2. Update application statistics
  3. Monitor join performance

## Phase 2: Medium-Impact Indexes

### 3. orders(o_totalprice)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Rationale**:
  * Improves 2 queries with 100% effectiveness
  * Moderate storage impact (28.6 MB)
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Implement during maintenance window
  2. Monitor storage growth
  3. Validate query performance

### 4. part(p_size)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Rationale**:
  * 100% improvement on target query
  * Low storage impact (3.8 MB)
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create index
  2. Update statistics
  3. Monitor range query performance

## Phase 3: High-Cost Index

### 5. lineitem(l_suppkey)
- **Priority**: Lower
- **Rationale**:
  * Significant storage impact (114.4 MB)
  * Benefits one query with 100% improvement
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Evaluate storage capacity
  2. Implement during major maintenance window
  3. Monitor storage and performance impact

## Monitoring Plan

### Daily Monitoring
1. Query Performance
   - Track execution times for affected queries
   - Compare with baseline measurements
   - Alert on significant deviations

2. Storage Impact
   - Monitor index sizes
   - Track growth rates
   - Verify against predictions

3. Index Usage
   - Monitor index hit rates
   - Track query patterns
   - Identify unused indexes

### Weekly Analysis
1. Performance Review
   - Compare actual vs. predicted improvements
   - Analyze query pattern changes
   - Adjust recommendations if needed

2. Storage Review
   - Analyze index size growth
   - Review compression opportunities
   - Plan for capacity needs

### Monthly Assessment
1. Comprehensive Review
   - Validate index benefits
   - Analyze workload changes
   - Update recommendations

2. Optimization Opportunities
   - Identify unused indexes
   - Review index combination effectiveness
   - Suggest modifications

## Rollback Plan

### For Each Index
1. Backup
   - Create logical backup of affected tables
   - Document current performance metrics

2. Rollback Triggers
   - Performance degradation > 10%
   - Storage impact exceeds 120% of estimate
   - Unexpected query patterns

3. Rollback Steps
   - Drop problematic index
   - Verify system stability
   - Reassess implementation strategy

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
