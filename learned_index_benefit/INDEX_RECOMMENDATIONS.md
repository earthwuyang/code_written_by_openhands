## Workload Analysis

### TP (Transaction Processing) Workload
- Overall improvement: 11.6%
- Best case improvement: 100%
- Average improvement: 25%
- Most beneficial for point queries on orders and parts

### AP (Analytical Processing) Workload
- Overall improvement: 12%
- Best case improvement: 39.3%
- Average improvement: 14.9%
- Benefits from both single-column and composite indexes

## Storage Considerations

Total storage impact for recommended indexes: 153.5 MB
- Largest index: lineitem(l_suppkey) at 114.4 MB
- Most efficient: customer(c_custkey) at 2.9 MB per query improved

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Phased Implementation**
   - Start with indexes on orders(o_totalprice) and part(p_container)
   - Monitor performance impact
   - Add remaining indexes based on observed benefits

2. **Priority Order**
   - High Priority: orders(o_totalprice), part(p_container)
   - Medium Priority: customer(c_custkey), part(p_size)
   - Consider Later: lineitem(l_suppkey) due to storage impact

3. **Monitoring Recommendations**
   - Track actual query performance improvements
   - Monitor storage usage
   - Validate benefit/cost ratio

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

Combined benefit of top 5 indexes: 5.8% total cost reduction across all queries

### Benefits
- Significant improvement for point queries (up to 100%)
- Moderate improvement for analytical queries (12-15%)
- Good coverage of both TP and AP workloads

### Costs
- Total storage overhead: 153.5 MB
- Maintenance overhead for updates
- Index update costs for write operations

## Future Considerations

1. **Workload Evolution**
   - Monitor query patterns changes
   - Adjust index strategy based on usage patterns
   - Consider removing unused indexes

2. **Performance Tuning**
   - Regular validation of index usage
   - Consider composite indexes for frequently combined conditions
   - Monitor and adjust based on actual query patterns

3. **Storage Management**
   - Regular monitoring of index sizes
   - Consider partitioning for large tables
   - Implement index maintenance procedures
